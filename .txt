I have backend as fake-apis.
Using data from this backend 

Create a ProductListContainer that handles:

API calls and data fetching
Cart management
Error handling
Create a ProductListPresenter that handles:

Rendering products
Sort/filter UI interactions
Add to cart button clicks
Break down into smaller presenters:

ProductCard
SortFilterControls
CartSummary


Use: javascript, ReactJs, Tailwind CSS, express, nodejs


Success Criteria
Container has no JSX rendering logic
Presenter has no API calls or business logic
Components are reusable and testable
Clear separation of concerns
